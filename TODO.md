# Solution Tree Context Menu & Functionality TODO

This document tracks the missing functionality and improvements needed for the Solution Tree context menus and interactions to match Visual Studio behavior.

## üö® Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### Tree

- [x] **File watcher architecture** - Fixed! Now uses lazy folder watchers created only when folders are expanded
  - [x] Solution/project files watched globally with flat watchers (`**/*.sln`, `**/*.{csproj,vbproj,fsproj}`)
  - [x] Individual project files watched per project
  - [x] Folder watchers created lazily when folders are expanded, removed when collapsed
- [x] **Dependencies node temporarily disabled** - Causing collapse bug, moved to Project Node Context Menu priority list

### Context Menu Fixes

- [x] **Dependencies node** should NOT have Rename, Delete, or Reveal in Explorer options
- [x] **Solution folders** should NOT have "Open" action (they're virtual folders)
- [x] **Solution node** should have Rename option
- [x] **Project nodes** (.csproj) should have Delete/Remove options
- [x] **Enter key on solution folders** should trigger expand/collapse (not try to open)
- [x] **Solution node** rename functionality implemented
- [x] **Dependencies node** "Reveal in Explorer" option removed

### Node Type Detection Issues

- [x] **Distinguish solution folders from regular folders** - currently both are type 'folder'
- [x] **Add 'solution' node type** handling in context menus
- [x] **Fix Dependencies node** to be properly identified (currently shows regular folder menu)

### Tree Navigation Issues

- [x] **Solution folders** cannot expand/collapse properly
- [x] **Left clicking on files** should collapse the tree node (currently doesn't work)
- [x] **Left arrow key on files** should collapse the tree node (currently doesn't work)
- [x] **Context menu focus** - opening context menu should focus it for keyboard navigation (up/down arrows)

## üìã Missing Context Menu Actions (Priority 2)

### Solution Node Context Menu

- [x] Add Existing Project (file dialog to select .csproj) [can we just use the file picker thingy?]
- [x] Add New Project (project template selection) [QuickPick for now]
- [ ] Add Solution Folder

### Solution Folder Context Menu

- [ ] Add New Project
- [ ] Add Existing Project
- [ ] Add Solution Folder (sub-folder)
- [ ] Remove (from solution, not filesystem)
- [ ] Rename (already implemented)
- [ ] Restore Nugets
- [ ] Build commands (Clean, Build, Rebuild) like on project node.

### Project Node Context Menu

- [ ] **Dependencies node functionality** (PRIORITY - currently disabled due to collapse bug)
  - [ ] Restore Dependencies container node display
  - [ ] Fix collapse bug when clicking dependencies node
  - [ ] Implement dependencies expansion to show individual packages
  - [ ] Add context menu for dependencies (Manage NuGet Packages, Add Reference, etc.)
- [ ] Add Reference
- [ ] Add Project Reference
- [ ] Manage NuGet Packages
- [ ] Add Class/Item (with templates)
- [ ] Add Folder
- [ ] Set as Startup Project
- [ ] Properties (Properties are a folder so I think this part can wait until we do the ui for it)
- [ ] Remove from Solution (different from Delete)
- [ ] Delete (filesystem deletion)
- [ ] Set as Startup project [startup project should be "bold" in the tree ]

### File Context Menu

- [ ] Copy/Cut/Paste

### Folder Context Menu

- [ ] Add Class/Item
- [ ] Add Folder
- [ ] Copy/Cut/Paste

## üîß Functionality Gaps (Priority 3)

### Drag & Drop Support

- [ ] Drag files between folders
- [ ] Drag projects between solution folders
- [ ] Drag references between projects
- [ ] Visual drop indicators

### Copy/Cut/Paste Operations

- [ ] Copy file/folder paths to clipboard
- [ ] Cut/Copy files and folders
- [ ] Paste files into folders
- [ ] Duplicate files

### Multi-Selection Support

- [ ] Ctrl+Click for multi-select
- [ ] Shift+Click for range select
- [ ] Multi-select context menus
- [ ] Bulk operations (delete, move, etc.)

### Project Templates & Wizards

- [ ] New Project dialog with templates
- [ ] New Item dialog with templates (Class, Interface, etc.)
- [ ] Project template discovery and rendering

### File System Integration

- [ ] Watch for external file changes
- [ ] Auto-include newly created files
- [ ] Handle file renames from filesystem
- [ ] Exclude patterns (.gitignore, etc.)

## üéØ Behavioral Improvements (Priority 4)

### Keyboard Navigation Enhancements

- [ ] Delete key for deletion
- [ ] Ctrl+X/C/V for cut/copy/paste
- [ ] Escape to cancel operations

### Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Loading indicators for long operations
- [ ] Error states for failed operations
- [ ] Dirty indicators for unsaved files
- [ ] Build status indicators
- [ ] Source control status indicators
- [ ] Highlight currently active file in the tree.
- [ ] Error visualizer, indicate files with errors / warnings

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large trees
- [ ] Lazy loading of deep folder structures
- [ ] Debounced file system operations
- [ ] Memoization of expensive tree operations

## üîÑ Integration Points (Priority 5)

### VS Code Integration

- [ ] Integrate with VS Code source control
- [ ] Respect VS Code file associations
- [ ] Use VS Code file icons
- [ ] Integrate with VS Code search

### Build System Integration

- [ ] Real-time build status
- [ ] Error/warning indicators
- [ ] Build output integration
- [ ] Test runner integration

### NuGet Integration

- [ ] Package reference management
- [ ] Package updates notifications
- [ ] Package vulnerability warnings
- [ ] Package search and install

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Missing Test Coverage

- [ ] Context menu actions for each node type
- [ ] Enter key behavior for different node types
- [ ] Project operations (add, remove, build)
- [ ] File operations (include, exclude, delete)
- [ ] Solution operations (add project, add folder)
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases

### Integration Testing

- [ ] File system operation tests
- [ ] Build operation tests
- [ ] NuGet operation tests
- [ ] VS Code API integration tests

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Current Context Menu Logic Issues

The current implementation in `ContextMenu.tsx` is too simplistic:

- Uses basic node types (file, folder, project, dependency)
- Doesn't distinguish between solution folders and filesystem folders
- Missing solution node handling
- Dependencies node treated as regular folder

### Node Type Improvements Needed

Need to enhance the type system to distinguish:

- `solution` - .sln file node
- `solutionFolder` - Virtual folder in solution
- `project` - .csproj file node
- `folder` - Filesystem folder
- `file` - Regular file
- `dependencies` - Dependencies virtual folder
- `dependency` - Individual package reference

### Action Handler Extensions

The `SolutionWebviewProvider` needs new handlers for:

- Project management (add, remove, unload)
- Solution structure operations (add folder, add project)
- File operations (include, exclude, templates)
- Build and test operations
- NuGet operations

**Next Steps**: Address Priority 1 issues first to fix the immediate UX problems, then work through the remaining priorities systematically.
